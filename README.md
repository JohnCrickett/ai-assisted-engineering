## AI Assisted Engineering Process

### How To Leverage AI In The Software Engineering Process

### How To Prompt LLMs

### How And Why To Provide Context

## Key Concepts

### Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering refers to the crafting of effective prompts for an LLM. The focus on a prompt is telling a model how to behave and what to do.

### Context Engineering

Context engineering focuses on provifing the model with the information it needs to undertake a development task. It provides an LLM with the details it needs to understand your project and how the task fits into it. In the case of AI-assisted software engineering that will include details such as your code, your files, your data models, your dependencies, your architecture, your coding style guidelines and any relevant domain knowledge.


Context can be made up of :

- **Immediate knowledge**: for example the prompt, current task, and current files.
- **Persistent knowledge**: project documentation, issue trackers, codebase and structured data.
- **Memory**: this could be short-term, i.e. conversation and task history or longer-term preferences encoded into project settings.
- **Organisational patterns**: best practices, ways of working and convetions.
