## A
- Agent - An AI agent is a software program that can autonomously interact with its environment to get information, make decisions, and take actions to achieve a high-level goal.

## C
- Context Engineering - Context engineering is building systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that an LLM can accomplish a task. It covers instructions, long term memory, state, history, RAG, tools, skills and prompts.

- Custom Instructions - Custom Instructions allow for the customisation of an LLM, allowing you to specify the behaviours, preferences and constraints it should work to.

## L
- LLM - A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained using self-supervised machine learning on a large amount of text. They are designed for natural language processing tasks. The most widely used are generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs).

## M
- MCP - MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems. Using MCP, AI applications can connect to data sources (e.g. local files, databases), tools (e.g. search engines, calculators) and workflows (e.g. specialized prompts), enabling them to access key information and perform tasks.

## P
- Prompt Engineering - Prompt engineering is the process of designing and creating instructions (prompts) to guide a generative AI model to produce the desired output.
