# Agents.md
The AGENTS.md is a simple, open format for guiding coding agents.

You can think of AGENTS.md as a README for coding agents: a specific, predictable place to provide context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

The AGENTS.md file is often overused, many engineers and teams place too much into it and polute the context window.
