8 terminal AI agents every software engineer should know in 2025.

I’m all in on terminal agents. They offer more power and flexibility than IDE based solutions.

All major AI labs launched terminal coding agents this year. Here's which to use:

1. Claude Code - Best by far. Expensive and Anthropic models only.

2. Goose - Free, any LLM, supports local models (rust based)

3. Aider - One of the original terminal agents.

4. Gemini CLI - It’s Google. It’s good.

5. Qwen Code - Fork of Gemini CLI for powerful Qwen Coder model.

6. Codex CLI - Good for OpenAI users

7. Cursor CLI (use Cursor outside of VS Code)

8. Cline CLI - A popular tool for enterprise. Recently released CLI tool.

Which are you using?
